# SpriteWorldX2
An SDL2 port of SpriteWorld / SpriteWorldX.
Work in Progress.

### About:

This is an SDL2-compatible port of [SpriteWorld](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spriteworld/) / [SpriteWorldX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spriteworldx/). It was done as a somewhat quick stepping stone in getting a game based on the original SpriteWorld to run in current hardware and SDL2.

SpriteWorldX2 is released under MIT license. It's ancestors were released under zlib.

### Known Limitations:

* Particles are disabled.
* The library largely depends on `SDL_Surface`, which back in SDL1 could be hardware-accelerated. SDL2 surfaces however are software-only, so the performance is not mind-blowing. To improve performance, eventually either the library should be based entirely on GL or a substantial part of the codebase whould be rewritten to at least use `SDL_Texture` most of the time.

### Dependencies (automatically fetched during cmake):

* [SDL2<sup>1</sup>](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [SDL2_ttf<sup>1</sup>](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* [SDL2_image<sup>1</sup>](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* Cocoa<sup>2</sup>

<sup>1</sup>: automatically fetched by cmake process if path not specified.

<sup>2</sup>: if building for OSX.

### How to Build:
The project uses camke to build (Xcode only as of now -- more to come). So you can do:

```
git clone <repo url>
cd <local-repo>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G <generator> ..
<open Xcode project and build>
```
